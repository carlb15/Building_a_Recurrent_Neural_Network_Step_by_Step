# Building a Recurrent Neural Network Step by Step  
  
Implementing a [Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) and [Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) with numpy.  
  
# Implementation:  
1. Implement the calculations needed for one time-step of the RNN and LSTM.  
   a. RNN Forward Propagation Cell  
   b. LSTM Forward Propagation Cell  
2. Implement a loop over T_x time-steps in order to process all the inputs, one at a time.    
3. Implement Back Propagation  
   a. RNN Back Propagation Cell  
   b. LSTM Back Propagation Cell
